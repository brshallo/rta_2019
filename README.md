*Slides and materials for Research Triangle Analysts talk in Durham on 2019-08-20 on "Managing many objects in dataframesâ€¦ with examples in hierarchical forecasting".*

This repo contains the slides (as a pdf) as well as the code for the hiearchical forecasting with `prophet` example. For the code used to create the other examples, see the repo from a previous talk: https://github.com/brshallo/iaa_2019 . (Code to second hiearchical forecasting example that uses `forecast` package is not shared).

Technical issues --> recording not available, however a similar but highly abbreviated version of a related talk (that I delivered previously) can be found here: https://youtu.be/gme4Fb9JVjk .

**Open an issue:**

If you would like me to flesh-out any of the examples I alluded to on the "Other examples..." slide, open an issue and I'll make a post (these, or similar, examples are also covered by materials produced by others, as mentioned in the "resources" slide.)
