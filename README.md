*Slides and materials for Research Triangle Analysts talk in Durham on 2019-08-20 on "Managing many objects in dataframesâ€¦ with examples in hierarchical forecasting".*

Technical issues --> recording not available, however a similar but highly abbreviated version of this talk (that I delivered previously) can be found here: https://youtu.be/gme4Fb9JVjk .

This repo contains the slides (as a pdf) as well as the code for the hiearchical forecasting in `profit` example. For the code used to create the other examples, see the repo from a previous talk: https://github.com/brshallo/iaa_2019 . (Code not shared for second hiearchical forecasting example using `forecast` package).

**Open an issue:**

If you would like me to flesh-out any of the examples I alluded to on the "Other examples..." slide, open an issue and I'll make a post (these, or similar, examples are also showcased by the materials mentioned on the "resources" slide.)
